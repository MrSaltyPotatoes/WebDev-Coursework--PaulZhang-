# üåç Reflection on Unit: Global Goals and Website Design

In this unit, I explored how websites can be used to support meaningful change in the world. I learned about the **Global Goals** and practiced connecting them to real-life challenges. I worked on:

- **Understanding the Global Goals** and why they matter in solving today‚Äôs global problems  
- **Analyzing the design and content** of the website to learn what makes it effective

I also learned how to combine this knowledge with design skills. I:

- Applied the **Design Thinking Process** to plan a website that supports a Global Goal  
- Chose a goal and target that is meaningful in my own community  
- Started designing a website that responds to that local need

This unit showed me how web design contribute to development of the world by exploring global goals.
