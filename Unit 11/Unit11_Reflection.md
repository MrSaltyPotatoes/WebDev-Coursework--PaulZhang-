# üåê Reflection on Unit: Final Reflection

When I first started learning web design, I felt a mix of curiosity and uncertainty. On one hand, I was excited to explore something new and practical. On the other hand, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had the technical skills to build a working website. I had used websites all my life, but making one seemed like something only professionals could do.

At the beginning, I doubted whether I could keep up. I had no experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The idea of writing code felt overwhelming. I also worried that I might fall behind if the course moved too fast. But I told myself that learning new skills is supposed to be challenging at first. I was hoping to gain not only technical knowledge, but also the ability to express creativity through design.

As the course went on, my confidence started to grow. Step by step, I learned how websites are structured and how to control the way they look and function. I was surprised by how small changes in code could make a big difference on the screen. Building my own pages made me feel capable and proud. I especially enjoyed making design choices and thinking about how users would experience the site.

Now, I feel much more confident in my web design skills. I can plan and organize a website, use CSS to style it, and add basic interactivity with JavaScript. More importantly, I‚Äôve learned to be patient with the process. At first, the code felt like a puzzle. But now, I can see how each part fits together.

This course has taught me more than just technical skills‚Äîit has changed how I think. I now see websites not just as digital tools, but as creative spaces where design and function come together. That‚Äôs something I never expected when I started, and I‚Äôm glad I took the first step.

Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was not always easy. Each language had its own logic and rules, and it took time to get used to switching between them. One of the biggest challenges for me was understanding how everything fits together. At first, I didn‚Äôt know where to write each type of code or how they all connect to make a complete website.

In HTML, I struggled with structure. I often forgot to close tags or got confused by elements. In CSS, it was hard to make my pages look the way I imagined. Sometimes, I applied styles but nothing changed, and I didn‚Äôt know why. With JavaScript, the biggest challenge was logic. Writing functions and using variables felt confusing, especially when things didn‚Äôt work as expected.

To overcome these challenges, I practiced a lot. I tried different examples and built simple web pages again and again. When something didn‚Äôt work, I used the browser‚Äôs developer tools to figure out what was wrong. I also asked my teacher and classmates for help when I got stuck.
