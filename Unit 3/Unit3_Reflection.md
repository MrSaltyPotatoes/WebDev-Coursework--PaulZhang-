# ðŸ§­ Reflection on Unit: Knowing Your Audience

In Unit 3, I learned that to build a **successful website**, the first thing I need to do is **understand who the users are**. This means finding my **target audience** â€” the group of people the website is made for.

The learning platform gave me three different clients to choose from. I picked **Kai**, a boy who loves **poetry** and **traveling**. Based on what I learned about him, I decided to create a **travel agency website** that would attract people like Kai â€” people who enjoy meaningful travel experiences and discovering new places.

By thinking about what Kai likes, I could design the website in a way that feels personal and exciting for users like him.
