# Reflection on Unit: how to build a webpage

In Unit 1, I learned how to create a basic website using HTML. Even though the website I built might be one of the most boring websites in the world — since it doesn’t have any interactive features yet — I still feel proud of what I’ve made. It was my first time building something that could actually appear on the internet, and that gave me a real sense of accomplishment.

I also learned how to format text on a web page. For example:

- I can **bold** important words using the `<strong>` tag.
- I can *italicize* text to make it stand out using the `<em>` tag.
- I can add headings using `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and so on to organize content.

These tools help make a web page easier to read and understand. A simple change like making a word bold can help show what’s important.
