# üóÇÔ∏è Reflection on Unit: Website Structure, Navigation, and Design

In this unit, I learned how to better **organize, build, and improve** a multi-page website. I explored the structure of professional websites and applied what I learned to my own project.

I also worked on improving the user experience by learning how to build:

- A **navigation bar** that links to different pages like **Home**, **About**, and **Contact**  
- The **HTML structure** and **CSS styling** needed to make the navigation bar look clean and work smoothly  

In the final part of the unit, I focused on design and improvement. I learned:

- How to think about **design choices** that affect how users experience my website  
- How to apply **best practices in web design**, including keeping things simple, and making the site accessible  

This unit helped me see how everything‚Äîstructure, style, navigation, and thoughtful design‚Äîcomes together to create a strong, user-friendly website.
