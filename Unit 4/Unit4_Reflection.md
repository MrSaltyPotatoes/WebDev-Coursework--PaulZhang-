# ðŸ’¡ Reflection on Unit 4: Making Websites Clear and Effective

In Unit 4, I learned how to make a website that delivers its message more clearly and directly. One important thing I discovered is how to use **ordered lists** and **unordered lists**. These help me organize information in a simple way, so visitors can quickly understand what I want to share.

For example:  
- Unordered lists are good for short points.  
- Ordered lists are great when steps or order matters.

I also learned that **sizing images** is very important. A picture that is too big or too small can make the website look unbalanced or messy. By choosing the right size, I can make sure the images match the layout and help people focus on whatâ€™s important.

This unit helped me understand that even small details like lists and image size can make a big difference in how a website communicates.
