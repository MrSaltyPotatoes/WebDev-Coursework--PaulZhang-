# ðŸ”— Reflection on Unit: Links and Page Polish

In this unit, I learned how to improve both the **link funtion** and **appearance** of a website. I practiced several useful skills, including:

- **Adding links** to help users move to other pages or websites  
- **Using absolute and relative paths** to correctly connect pages and resources  
- **Styling links** with CSS to make them more attractive and interactive  
- **Adding favicons** to show a small icon in the browser tab  
- **Using the `<span>` tag** to style specific words or parts of text

These techniques helped my website be more attractive to my client. The website now looks more professional and is easier for users to explore.
