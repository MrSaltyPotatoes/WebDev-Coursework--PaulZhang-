# ðŸŽ¨ Reflection on Unit 5: Styling with CSS

In Unit 5, I learned how to use **CSS** to make websites look better and easier to read. I practiced changing different parts of a webpageâ€™s style, including:

- **Background color** to set the mood of the page  
- **Text color** to make the content stand out  
- **Font family** to choose a style that matches the message  
- **Font size** to make sure the text is readable for everyone


This unit showed me how powerful and fun CSS can be. Even small changes like colors or fonts can make a big difference in how users feel when they visit a website.
