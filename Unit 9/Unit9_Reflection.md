# üñ±Ô∏è Reflection on Unit: Getting Started with JavaScript

In this unit, I was introduced to **JavaScript**, a powerful tool for making websites more interactive. I learned:

- What **JavaScript** is and how it adds behavior to web pages  
- How to use JavaScript to **display a simple message**  
- How to **link JavaScript to an HTML button**, so something happens when the button is clicked  

I also explored how JavaScript can interact with HTML elements directly. I practiced:

- Accessing **HTML elements and their attributes** using JavaScript  
- Changing the **innerHTML** of an element to update text dynamically on the page  

This unit helped me understand how JavaScript can bring a web page to life and respond to what users do. It was exciting to see my web page actually "react" to clicks!
