# ðŸ§± Reflection on Unit: Advanced CSS and Web Layout

In this unit, I learned how to use **CSS and HTML** more effectively to improve the layout and structure of a website. I explored new tools and techniques that help organize content and make web pages look more professional. I practiced:

- Using the HTML **`<div>` element** and **class attributes** to group and style content  
- Applying **CSS styles** to improve the visual appearance of different sections on a web page  

I also discovered how layout works behind the scenes by exploring:

- The **CSS box model**, which helped me understand how margins, borders, padding, and content work together  
- The **position property** and how its 5 typesâ€”static, relative, absolute, fixed, and stickyâ€”can change where elements appear  
- Adjusting the **top, bottom, left, and right values** to control precise placement on the page  

Later, I focused on controlling how elements appear by learning about:

- The **CSS display property** and its key values: `none`, `inline`, `block`, `inline-block`, `flex`, and `grid`  
- Applying these ideas directly to my own website to improve looking

This unit gave me a deeper understanding of how to create websites that are both beautiful and functional on all devices.
